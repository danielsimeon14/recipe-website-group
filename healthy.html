            <p><h3>In a medium bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, nutmeg, cinnamon (if using), and salt. Set this bowl aside.

              <br>. Cream Butter and Sugar:
              In a large bowl, cream the softened butter and sugar together using an electric mixer or by hand with a whisk until the mixture is light and fluffy (about 3-5 minutes).
              
              <br>. Add Eggs and Vanilla:
              Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.
              
              <br>. Add Dry Ingredients and Milk:
              Gradually add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture, alternating with the milk (start with dry ingredients and end with milk). Mix until just combined.
              
              If using sour cream or yogurt, fold it in at this stage for added moisture.
              
              <br>. Mix Until Smooth:
              Mix everything together until the batter is smooth and fully combined, but be careful not to overmix.
              
              <br>. Pour into Pan:
              Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and spread it evenly.</h3>

              Blend 1 cup of watermelon chunks and 1/2 cup of soursop pulp in a blender.
              <br>
              Add 1-2 tablespoons of honey or sweetener (optional).
              <br>
              Pour in 1/2 cup of water or coconut water for smoother consistency.
              <br>

                Wash all the fruits thoroughly.
                
                Peel the fruits as needed (e.g., bananas, oranges, or pineapple).
                
                Cut fruits into bite-sized pieces. For example:
                <br>
                Apples: Core and slice into small chunks.
                <br>
                Bananas: Slice into rounds.
                <br>
                Strawberries: Hull and slice into halves or quarters.
                <br>
                Grapes: Cut them in half if they’re large, or leave them whole if they’re small.
                <br>
                Pineapple: Cut the skin off and dice into small cubes.
                <br>
                Combine the Fruits:
                <br>
                In a large mixing bowl, gently combine all the cut fruit pieces together.
                
                Add Flavor (optional):
                <br>
                Drizzle a bit of honey or lemon juice over the fruit for extra flavor.
                
                A pinch of cinnamon or a few mint leaves can also add a nice twist.
                <br>
                Toss the Salad:
                
               <br> Gently toss the fruit together to mix the flavors without mashing the fruits.
